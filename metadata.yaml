description: Published in 1912, this history begins with the foundations of prehistoric
  England (55 bc) and continues through 1911 from the basic foundation of a country,
  through the emergence of a people and a national identity, self-government, expansion,
  industrial revolution, and finally to an empire. The volume also includes a concluding
  chapter on the distinctive elements of English democracy.
